# data_analysis_mysql_workbench

## INTRO

I just copied the some of the important information from the coursera project page.
In this project, you will step into the shoes of an entry-level data analyst at
the fictional Mint Classics Company, helping to analyze data in a relational database with the goal of supporting 
inventory-related business decisions that lead to the closure of a storage facility.

## DESCRIPTION

Project Objectives:
1. Explore products currently in inventory.
2. Determine important factors that may influence inventory reorganization/reduction.
3. Provide analytic insights and data-driven recommendations.
